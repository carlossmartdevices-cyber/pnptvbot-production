# PNPtv! Brand Identity & Correct Use Guide

This document outlines the visual elements and rules necessary to maintain a consistent, premium, and exclusive brand experience for PNPtv! across all digital touchpoints.

## 1. Brand Overview

The PNPtv! identity is built on the concept of **"Digital Nightlife."** It combines the exclusivity of a private members' club with the vibrant energy of a late-night digital venue. The visual language is dark, glowing, and confident, designed to stand out in a crowded digital space while signaling a premium, adult-only experience.

## 2. The Logo System

Our logo system consists of two primary assets: the **Primary Logo** for main brand identification and the **Brand Mark** for shorthand use. Both must always be treated with respect to maintain their impact.

### Primary Logo & Brand Mark

*(Refer to image_14.png for the visual of the logos, clear space, and minimum size)*

- **Primary Logo:** The "PNPtv!" text within the glowing squircle. This is the main identifier for apps, websites, and social profiles.
- **Brand Mark:** The standalone glowing diamond/star. Use this for favicons, subtle watermarks, or as a design element.
- **Clear Space:** Always maintain a minimum clear space around the logo equal to the height of the letter 'P' to ensure legibility and impact.
- **Minimum Size:** Neither logo should be used smaller than **64px** in height to preserve the integrity of the neon glow effect.

## 4. Incorrect Use

To maintain brand integrity, it is vital to avoid these common mistakes. The logo's power comes from its neon glow against a dark background.

### Examples of Incorrect Use

*(Refer to image_16.png for the visual examples of incorrect logo usage)*

- **DO NOT** place the logo on a light or white background. The neon effect will be lost.
- **DO NOT** render the logo in a single, flat color. The gradient is essential.
- **DO NOT** stretch, compress, or distort the logo's proportions.
- **DO NOT** place text or other elements inside the logo's clear space.

## 5. Real-World Application

Here is an example of how the brand identity should be applied in its primary context: a Telegram bot. The Primary Logo is used as the main avatar, and the Brand Mark is used to accent premium messaging.
