## FAQs

### Can I change my Bluesky handle later?

Not directly from pnptv, but you can register a custom domain handle on Bluesky. The `@username.pnptv.app` handle is permanent and controlled by your pnptv account.

### What if my username is already taken on Bluesky?

Very unlikely, but if it is:
1. Contact pnptv support
2. We can regenerate a unique handle for you
3. Takes less than 5 minutes

### Is my data safe on Bluesky?

**Yes.** Bluesky is a decentralized network - you own your data. You can export your account anytime or move it elsewhere. No vendor lock-in.

### Will my pnptv posts appear on Bluesky?

**No.** Bluesky is a separate social network. You post separately there.

Your pnptv content stays on pnptv. Your Bluesky content stays on Bluesky. They're not connected - just your account is.

### Can I disconnect my Bluesky account?

Yes! In your pnptv dashboard:
1. Go to Bluesky card
2. Click "Disconnect"
3. Your Bluesky account still exists (you own it)
4. But it's no longer linked to your pnptv profile

### What happens if I delete my pnptv account?

Your Bluesky account remains active and is yours forever. The linking just gets removed.

## Troubleshooting

### "Handle already taken" error

This shouldn't happen, but if it does:
- Try refreshing the page
- If problem persists, contact support with your username

### Account not appearing on Bluesky immediately

Sometimes takes 30-60 seconds to appear. Just refresh your browser and search for `@yourname.pnptv.app`.

### Profile photo didn't sync

Make sure you have:
1. Uploaded an avatar on pnptv
2. Avatar is a standard image format (PNG, JPEG, WebP)
3. Waited a few seconds after upload

If still not working, try disconnecting and reconnecting your Bluesky account.
